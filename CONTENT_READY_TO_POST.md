### DAY 1: ANNOUNCEMENT

**Post 1.1 - Opening Tweet:**
```
I'm building the first project management tool designed for AI agents.

Launch in 10 days.

Here's why this matters 🧵

(1/8)
```

**Post 1.2 - The Problem:**
```
Current PM tools were built for humans only.

Asana. Monday. ClickUp. Notion.

Your AI assistant can't touch them.

That changes today.

(2/8)
```

**Post 1.3 - The Solution:**
```
Introducing ProjoFlow:

→ Built on MCP (Model Context Protocol)
→ Your AI can create projects
→ Your AI can manage tasks
→ Your AI can log time
→ Fully autonomous or assisted

The first PM tool AI assistants can actually use.

(3/8)
```

**Post 1.4 - Use Case:**
```
Imagine this:

You: "Claude, create a project for the website redesign"

Your AI:
✅ Creates project
✅ Breaks down tasks
✅ Assigns priorities
✅ Estimates time
✅ Updates you

All automatically through ProjoFlow.

That's the future. And it's launching in 10 days.

(4/8)
```

**Post 1.5 - Tech Stack:**
```
Built with:
→ Next.js 14
→ Supabase
→ MCP SDK
→ Stripe
→ TypeScript

Open to feedback on the stack. What would you change?

(5/8)
```

**Post 1.6 - Build Timeline:**
```
Timeline:
→ Feb 1: First commit
→ Feb 4: MCP integration working
→ Feb 5: Landing page mockup
→ Feb 10: Beta release
→ Feb 15: Product Hunt launch

7-day build. Fully functional. With AI co-founder.

(6/8)
```

**Post 1.7 - The Team:**
```
Team:
→ Me (human founder, full-stack)
→ Mike (AI assistant, co-builder)

Yes, half this product was built by an AI.

The AI even tested itself using the product.

Meta? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.

(7/8)
```

**Post 1.8 - Call to Action:**
```
Follow along for:
→ Daily build updates
→ Behind-the-scenes
→ Lessons learned
→ Launch day chaos

And get early access when we go live.

Let's build something different.

(8/8)
```

### DAY 2-3: BUILD IN PUBLIC

**Post 2.1 - Progress Update:**
```
Day 2 of building ProjoFlow 🛠️

Shipped today:
✅ Project creation flow
✅ Task management UI
✅ MCP server (18 tools)
✅ User authentication

Tomorrow: Stripe integration + pricing page

Building in public is nerve-wracking but addictive.

[Add screenshot]
```

**Post 2.2 - MCP Demo:**
```
Just recorded this:

My AI assistant creating a project, adding tasks, and logging time.

Zero clicks from me.

This is what PM tools should have been from day one.

[Add video/GIF]
```

**Post 2.3 - Lesson Learned:**
```
Lesson from building with an AI co-founder:

AI is incredible at:
→ Boilerplate code
→ Test writing
→ Documentation
→ Debugging

Humans are better at:
→ Architecture decisions
→ UX intuition
→ Product vision

Best combo: Human leads, AI executes.
```

### DAY 4-5: FEATURE SPOTLIGHTS

**Post 3.1 - Feature: MCP Integration:**
```
Why ProjoFlow is different (Part 1):

MCP Integration 🤖

Your AI assistant can:
→ Read your projects
→ Create tasks
→ Update status
→ Log time entries
→ Add comments

No API wrestling. Just works.

[Add demo screenshot]
```

**Post 3.2 - Feature: White Label:**
```
Why ProjoFlow is different (Part 2):

White-label ready 🎨

Agencies can:
→ Custom brand colors
→ Upload their logo
→ Custom domain
→ Remove our branding

Make it yours in 5 minutes.

Perfect for consultancies.

[Add branding screenshot]
```

**Post 3.3 - Feature: Simple Pricing:**
```
Why ProjoFlow is different (Part 3):

Pricing that makes sense 💰

Pro: $29/mo
Business: $79/mo

No per-seat pricing.
No hidden fees.
No "contact sales."

Just pick a plan and go.

Simple.
```

---

### DAY 6-7: SOCIAL PROOF

**Post 4.1 - Beta Feedback:**
```
First beta tester just said:

"This is what Monday.com should have been if it wasn't bloated with features I'll never use."

Simple. Focused. AI-powered.

That's the goal.

6 days to launch.
```

**Post 4.2 - Technical Achievement:**
```
Small win today:

Our MCP server passed all 236 tests.

Zero security vulnerabilities.
100% RLS coverage.
Multi-tenant isolation working perfectly.

Ready for production.

5 days to launch.
```

Why we built ProjoFlow different 👇

We looked at Asana, Monday, ClickUp...

And asked: "What if we started from scratch in 2026?"

Here's what we changed:
→ AI-first (not AI-added)
→ Simple (not bloated)
→ White-label ready
→ Fair pricing

Built for agencies, consultancies, and dev teams who want less complexity, more results.

Launch: Feb 15 🚀
