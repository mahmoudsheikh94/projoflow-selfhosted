## 📝 LinkedIn Post (B2B Angle)

**Title:** Why We Stopped Paying $79/Month for Project Management

For the last 3 years, we paid $79/month for a project management SaaS.

$79 × 36 months = $2,844.

And we still didn't own anything.

Our client data lived on their servers. Our clients saw their branding. And when we wanted to integrate with our AI assistant? API hell.

So we built our own.

**Introducing ProjoFlow:**
A white-label, self-hosted project management system built for agencies who want control.

**What makes it different:**

1. **One-time purchase**  
   Pay once. Use forever. No recurring fees.

2. **Self-hosted**  
   Deploy on Vercel, Railway, or your own servers. Your database. Your rules.

3. **Full white-label branding**  
   Custom logo, colors, and domain. Clients see YOUR brand, not ours.

4. **Native AI integration (MCP)**  
   The only PM tool that Claude Code, Cursor, and Cline can natively control. No API setup. No middleware. Just works.

5. **You own the source code**  
   Modify it. Extend it. Customize it. It's yours.

**Who is this for?**

• Agencies managing client projects  
• Consultancies who value data ownership  
• Dev shops who want to white-label  
• Teams tired of monthly SaaS fees

**What you get:**

• Full Next.js/React source code  
• MCP server for AI integration  
• Client portal with role-based access  
• Time tracking & billing  
• White-label branding system  
• Deployment docs & setup wizard  
• Free updates forever

**First 100 licenses** include email support.

After that? You have the source code. Hire your own developers.

Early launch pricing: $TBD (lifetime access)

## 🎥 YouTube Video Script (5-Minute Demo)

**Title:** ProjoFlow — The Self-Hosted PM Tool Your AI Can Actually Use

**[0:00-0:30] Hook**

"What if I told you there's a project management tool that:
- Costs less than 6 months of ClickUp
- You own forever
- Your AI assistant can natively control
- And clients see YOUR branding, not theirs?

That's ProjoFlow. Let me show you."

**[0:30-1:30] The Problem**

"Agencies are stuck paying $79/month forever for PM tools.

Your data lives on their servers. Your clients see their branding. And when you want AI integration? You're stuck with janky API calls.

Meanwhile, you're paying $948/year. Forever.

After 3 years, that's $2,844. And you own nothing."

**[1:30-3:00] The Solution (Screen Recording)**

"ProjoFlow is different. Watch this.

[Screen: Vercel one-click deploy]
- Click 'Deploy'
- Connect Supabase
- Set environment variables
- 3 minutes later, you're live.

[Screen: Branding settings]
- Upload your logo
- Pick your colors
- Save

Your clients now see YOUR brand.

[Screen: MCP integration with Claude Code]
- 'Create a task in Project X'
- AI creates it instantly
- No API setup. It just works."

**[3:00-4:00] Who It's For**

"This is for:
- Agencies managing 5+ client projects
- Consultancies who value data ownership
- Dev shops who want white-label tools
- Anyone tired of monthly SaaS fees

You pay once. You own it. Forever."

**[4:00-4:45] What You Get**

"Here's what's included:

- Full source code (Next.js, React, TypeScript)
- MCP server for AI integration
- Client portal with secure invitations
- Time tracking & billing
- File attachments
- White-label branding
- Deployment docs
- Free updates forever

First 100 licenses get email support."

## 🔍 Reddit Post (r/AgencyOwners, r/webdev)

**Title:** [Tool] I built a self-hosted PM tool after 3 years of paying $79/month

**Body:**

For the last 3 years, my agency paid $79/month for ClickUp.

$2,844 later, we owned nothing. Client data on their servers. Their branding everywhere. Zero AI integration.

So I built **ProjoFlow** — a white-label, self-hosted PM tool with native AI integration.

**What it is:**
- Next.js/React project management system
- One-time license (not SaaS)
- Self-hosted (Vercel, Railway, your servers)
- Full white-label branding
- Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP) — AI assistants can natively control it

**What you get:**
- Full source code
- MCP server for Claude Code/Cursor/Cline
- Client portal with role-based access
- Time tracking & billing
- Free updates forever
- Email support (first 100 licenses)

**Why it exists:**

I was tired of:
- Monthly fees that never end
- Data on someone else's servers
- Generic branding
- Tools that don't integrate with AI

**Who it's for:**

Agencies, consultancies, dev shops who want:
- Control over their infrastructure
- White-label branding
- AI-native workflows
- One-time cost instead of monthly SaaS

**Early launch pricing:** $TBD (lifetime access)

Not here to spam — just sharing what I built. AMA in the comments.

### Email 2: MCP Setup Guide

**Subject:** ProjoFlow + Claude Code = 🤯 (Setup Guide)

Hey [Name],

Today we're setting up the coolest feature: MCP integration.

**What is MCP?**

Model Context Protocol lets AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline) natively control ProjoFlow.

No API setup. No middleware. Just works.

**Setup (5 minutes):**

1. Navigate to `/mcp-server` in your ProjoFlow repo
2. Follow the README for your AI assistant:
   • Claude Code: add to `openclaw.json`
   • Cursor: add to MCP settings
   • Cline: add to VS Code settings

3. Test it:
   • Ask your AI: "Create a task in [Project X]"
   • Watch it happen instantly

**What you can do:**

• "Create a task called 'Fix login bug'"
• "Log 2 hours to the homepage redesign task"
• "Show me all tasks assigned to John"
• "What's the status of Project X?"

Your AI can now manage your projects.

**Questions?**

Reply anytime.
