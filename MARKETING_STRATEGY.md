# ProjoFlow Marketing Strategy - Build in Public from Zero
**Created:** February 5, 2026  
**Goal:** Build hype, grow audience, launch with momentum  
**Starting Point:** 0 followers (X), 500 followers (Instagram), few (YouTube)  
**Timeline:** 10-14 days to launch  

---

## 🎯 Core Strategy: "Build in Public" + AI-First Angle

### Why This Works:
1. ✅ **Zero followers = perfect for build in public** (authentic growth story)
2. ✅ **AI/MCP is HOT right now** (Anthropic just released MCP, trending topic)
3. ✅ **Behind-the-scenes content** (people love the journey)
4. ✅ **Product demos = content gold** (showcase features naturally)
5. ✅ **Multi-platform repurposing** (one piece of content → 10 posts)

### Core Message:
> "We built the only project management tool your AI can control"

### Unique Angles:
1. **AI Assistant as Co-Founder** - Mike (AI) built half the product
2. **MCP-First Product** - Built for AI agents from day one
3. **7-Day Build** - From idea to launch in a week (compressed timeline)
4. **Jordan → Global** - Middle East founder building for global market

---

## 📱 Platform Strategy

### X (Twitter) - PRIMARY LAUNCH PLATFORM

**Why X First:**
- Tech/developer audience
- Product Hunt integration
- Viral potential with threads
- Real-time engagement
- AI/MCP community is here

2. **MCP/AI demos** (show the magic)
3. **Code snippets** (dev-friendly content)
4. **Lessons learned** (wins & fails)
5. **Launch countdown** (create urgency)

**Posting Schedule:**
- **Days 1-7:** 3 tweets/day (morning, afternoon, evening)

**Growth Tactics:**
